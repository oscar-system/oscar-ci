# parallelize: Whether to run tests in parallel.
# tests: Array of records with fields:
# name: Human readable name of the test.
# script: Filename of a shell script in the tests/ directory that
#   runs the tests. File must be executable.
# timeout: Time in seconds after which the test will be forcibly aborted.
# uses: this field contains a list of strings (resources) governs parallel
#   execution. Two tests cannot be run in parallel if they share a resource.
#   The special value "*" means that such a test cannot be run concurrently
#   with any other test. Every test also implicitly uses its test as a
#   resource. Thus, you can prevent one test from being run concurrently
#   with another by adding the other test's name to the 'uses' entry.
